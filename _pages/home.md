### Welcome!

I am a fifth-year Electronics and Electrical Communication dual degree student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, with a specialization in <b>Computer Vision and Machine Learning</b> for my master's. I'm currently trying to learn various concepts of intelligent systems, especially in visual data but not restricted to it. For my bachelor's thesis, I worked with <a href="http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ac.in/Eece/facultydetails/ece-gsaha">Prof. Gautham Saha</a> on novel phonocardiogram segmentation methodologies in the ABSP lab. I am fortunate enough to have interned in the <a href="https://jhalab.wustl.edu/">Computational Medical Imaging and Therapy lab</a> under <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Abhinav-Jha.html">Dr. Abhinav Jha</a> at Washington University in St. Louis, focusing on realism in synthetic SPECT scan data. I also interned under <a href="https://www.iitgn.ac.in/faculty/ee/fac-ravi">Prof. Ravi Hegde</a> at IIT Gandhinagar, working on vision-only-based action recognition of boxers in wild settings.
