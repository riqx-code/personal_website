### Welcome!

I am a fifth-year Electronics and Electrical Communication dual degree student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, with a specialization in <b>Computer Vision and Machine Learning</b> for my master's. I'm currently trying to learn various concepts of intelligent systems, especially in visual data but not restricted to it. For my bachelor's thesis, I worked with <a href="http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ac.in/Eece/facultydetails/ece-gsaha">Prof. Gautham Saha</a> on novel phonocardiogram segmentation methodologies in the ABSP lab. I am fortunate enough to have interned in the <a href="https://jhalab.wustl.edu/">Computational Medical Imaging and Therapy lab</a> under <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Abhinav-Jha.html">Dr. Abhinav Jha</a> at Washington University in St. Louis, focusing on realism in synthetic SPECT scan data. I also interned under <a href="https://www.iitgn.ac.in/faculty/ee/fac-ravi">Prof. Ravi Hegde</a> at IIT Gandhinagar, working on vision-only-based action recognition of boxers in wild settings.

### About me

I am a physicist working in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.
I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1939 and went on to earn my PhD from Princeton University in 1942.
After completing my doctoral studies, I worked on the Manhattan Project, where I helped develop the first atomic bombs.
After the war, I returned to academia, holding teaching and research positions at Cornell and now the California Institute of Technology.
